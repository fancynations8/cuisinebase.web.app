recipeinstructions:

- "Pour the batter into the loaf tin and smooth the top with the back of a wet spoon"
- "Bake for 45 - 55 minutes until golden and risen. If you remove the tin and tap the bottom of the loaf it should sound hollow when done. If the bottom of the loaf is still a bit damp after you remove the tin, put it back in the tin upsides down and bake a further 5 - 10 minutes. For a crusty loaf, return to the oven without the tin and bake a further 10 minutes"

- "Tastes lovely toasted"
- "You can replace the individual flours with a store pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend but you&#39;ll need to adjust the liquid added. Use the raisin water if you need to add extra or some orange juice to kick up the flavour a bit works well. The batter should be like cake batter"
- "Substitutions for Bara Brith / Welsh Fruit Cake - use 300g mixed fruit in place of raisins, replace golden syrup with 100g soft brown sugar, use 350ml brewed tea in place of warm water and soak mixed fruit in that - drain tea straight into batter and mix before adding the fruit in. Glaze with warm runny honey"
