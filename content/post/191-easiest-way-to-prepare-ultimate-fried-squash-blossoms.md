recipeingredient:
- "10 Squash Blossom"
- "3 Eggs"
- "1 cup Flour or parmesan cheese"
- "1 Oil to Fry"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you have a garden with ANY kind of squash ..be it zucchini, yellow straight or crooked neck, pumpkin or mellon (whatever) you are in LUCK!! The male flowers can be removed (all except for a couple) and you can eat them (oh yes you can and they are AMAZING) In the picture here you can see the difference - the female blossom on the left has the little bump that will be the fruit as it matures. The right one is a male. These are the ones you want to pick."
- "You want to pick them within I would say about an hour or so of when you want to make them because they dont really store very well ...they are pretty fragile. Once you have the boy flowers picked take them inside and rinse them gently with cold water (sometimes a bug will get stuck in the blossom) then i just put them in some cold water in a bowl until Im ready to cook them.** update.  If you choose to use pumpkin blossoms remove the little thingy in the middle of the blossom.. I think its called an anther.  They are a little bitter."
- "Wisk up some eggs - How many you used depends entirely on how many blossoms you have."
- "Now if you are on a low carb or keto diet I suggest you use parmesan cheese if not you can use plain flour (not self rising) - just put one or the other in a shallow pan."
- "Take a skillet and pour in some veg oil - it should be about a half inch deep at least - the bigger your skillet the more oil you will have to use - get your oil nice and hot - I usually put mine on med high - but this varies with your stove - you can test if its ready by putting in just a bit of the stem ..if it doesnt start boiling in the oil right away your oil probably isnt hot enough yet."
- "Once your oil is at a good temp - take a blossom - shake the excess water from it (NOT near the oil!!) then gently dip it into the whisked eggs coating the blossom"
- "Then dredge the egg covered blossom in either your flour or cheese. Take the blossom and gently place it in the oil - it should start boiling the instant you put it in. Move on to the next blossom and repeat until you have your pan full."
- "The Blossoms will need turned once - when they start turning a nice golden crispy color turn them over (usually happens pretty quick - by the time you finish adding the last one to the pan the first one you put in is usually ready to be flipped)"
- "Once both sides are crispy remove from the oil and I recommend placing on a paper towel or news paper to absorb access oil - I recommend salting them lighly right away after you remove each batch from the oil."
- "Then you just eat them - Now just last night (I should have taken pics!!) I tried a new twist and before I dipped them into the eggs I took a little chunk of cream cheese and placed it inside the flower - then did the egg and flower - it was very good. You could also mix crab meat or garlic or jalapeno into the cream cheese too - I think it would all be great."
- "The taste of just the plain blossem deep fried is very very similar to a morel mushroom. Which if you have ever had them are one of the yummiest things ever ...so these squash blossoms are great. If you are on a keto or low carb diet they are virtually carb free - I dont have the exact counts but if you add the tiny bit you get from the egg and the cheese its not very much at all :)  I will add more pics to this recipe soon!"
