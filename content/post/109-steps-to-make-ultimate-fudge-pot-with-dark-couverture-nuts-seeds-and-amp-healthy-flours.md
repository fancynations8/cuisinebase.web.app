A wide variety of dark chocolate couverture options are available to you, such as form, additional ingredient, and certification. The sorghum I use to make cookies. It adds a lovely sweetness all it&#39;s own. And I absolutely love that nuts sells these hard to find grains in one pound increments. Buttery fudge is spiked with fragrant cardamom then dipped in dark chocolate - sprinkle with freeze-dried raspberries for extra flavour.
