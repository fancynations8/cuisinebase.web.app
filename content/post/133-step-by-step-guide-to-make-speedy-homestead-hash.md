- "Chop bacon and add to pan."
- "Chop garlic, and set aside until potatoes and brussel sprouts have cooked through. Add to pan and stir frequently until garlic is brown."

- "(Optional Adjustment) If you&#39;re increasing the quantity to serve a whole family, instead of cooking your eggs separately, make little &#34;bowls&#34; in the hash for each egg. Simply crack the eggs into the hollows, cover the pan, and let the eggs cook to your preference and serve."
