- "Cover for 3.5 to 4 hours but, pull the beef short ribs at about 1.5 hours in. There&#39;s no need to flip meat. In fact, try not to peek! It will allow all your smoke to escape. It really is a precious commodity! Keep an eye on your steady 225¬∞ temp tho!"

- "Pull brisket and wrap immediately in tin foil. Allow brisket to rest for at least a half hour + before slicing. Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;ll still be hot!"
- "Side Dish - Stacked Baked Beans"
- "Side Dish - Potato Egg Salad"
- "Side Dish - Half chewed buttery, salty corn on the cob! Delicious!"
- "Slice your rested juicy brisket and plate."
- "Serve with buttery, salty corn on the cob, baked beans and chilled potato egg salad. I have a tasty recipe under my profile for both the salad and beans. You can also make excelent Brisket and Burnt End Sandwiches with thick dill pickle slices. You&#39;ll definitely want those sour pickles to cut the rich fat you&#39;ll find in your brisket. Enjoy!"
