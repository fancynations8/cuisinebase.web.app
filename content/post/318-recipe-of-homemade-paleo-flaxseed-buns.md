I especially love these flaxseed paleo tortillas for making salad wraps. When using flaxseeds for something like paleo tortillas, I prefer to grind the flaxseeds in my blender right before using them. These one-ingredient flaxseed wraps are vegan, paleo, and keto friendly. These flaxseed wraps are tender and soft from the flaxseeds, crunchy from the vegetables, and so easy to make. These grain free and Paleo almond butter banana muffins will become a family favorite for breakfast and snacks!
