recipeingredient:
- "1 ltr Freshly milled sorghum and millet flour mixed in cold water"
- "2 ltrs Water"
- " Sugar as required"
recipeinstructions:
- "The starting point is the fermentation process. Put the sorghum millet mixture in a jar and close the lid tightly. Keep in a dark area and allow it to ferment for at least four days or more but don’t exceed six days as it will be too sour."
- "After four days stir the mixture. In a large pot. Heat the water but before boiling point add in the flour slurry little by little as you stir vigorously with a wooden spoon."
- "Allow it to come to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer for 20 minutes then put off the fire. Allow to cool. Store in containers with tight fitting lids and use when needed. This can keep well for 1 week when refrigerated."
- "When needed just pour out a batch into a saucepan and bring it to a boil about 5 minutes. Add sugar and enjoy this labor of love. The taste is totally different from the store bought sour brands and is definitely better."

Porridge (historically also spelled porage, porrige, or parritch) is a food commonly eaten as a breakfast cereal dish, made by boiling ground, crushed or chopped starchy plants—typically grain—in water or milk. Guryev porridge is a classic Russian dish. Tender semolina combined with berries and nuts turn the dish into a dessert. Once you have your fermented starter, you can use it as part of your normal oat recipe to make either cooked porridge or raw bircher muesli/overnight oats.
