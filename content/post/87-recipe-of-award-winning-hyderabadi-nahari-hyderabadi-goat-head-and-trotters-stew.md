- "2 tbsp +1 tbsp Ginger garlic paste"
- "5 Green Chillies"
- "4 Bay leaves"
- "1/2 cup Potli Ka Masala"
- "For tempering"
- "2 tbsp Red chilli powder"
- "1 tbsp Garam masala"
- "1 tbsp Coriander powder"
- "2 Sliced and fried onions"

- "1/2 cup Jowar or Sorghum flour"
- "1-2 tbsp Oil"
- "1/2 cup Coriander leaves chopped"
- "7-8 Lemon wedges for serving"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large cooking pot, add the trotters. Now add the ginger-garlic paste. Add the green chillies and roughly chopped onions too. Also tie up the potli ka masala in a muslin cloth. Drop it in the pot along with 4-5 liters of water. Do not forget to add garam masala and bay leaves too and let it come to a rolling boil at first."
- "Then lower the heat and simmer for nearly 4-5 hours. Cover it up and leave it to simmer. Meanwhile, pressure cook the head parts with some salt and ginger garlic paste. You can also slow cook it alternatively on a low heat in another pot if desired. Also, add some red chilli powder according to taste."
- "After about 4-5 hours of slow cooking, remove the muslin cloth and throw it. Potli ka masala is a readymade masala packet available at every general store in Hyderabad. Now for tempering, Heat oil with red chilli powder and coriander powder along with a tablespoon of ginger garlic paste. After half a minute, add this to the pot."
- "Mix nicely roasted split dal and jowar flour in little water and add it to the pot as well. Add the fried and crushed onions too. Mix it well and let it cook until it thickens a bit for about 20 minutes or so. Also, add the pressure cooked head parts to this stew so that everything is incorporated really well."
- "After 20 minutes of simmering, it is all ready to serve garnished with lots of coriander. Serve this piping hot with naans and few lemon wedges alongside."
- "A classic breakfast recipe from the city of Hyderabad. Though it is made in most North Indian regions too but the one from Hyderabad stands out a little from them in terms of taste and the making process too. This is undoubtedly a super food nashta loved by most of the Hyderabadis. It is so very synonymous with them as the dum biryani. So very yummy because it is slow cooked and the special potli ka masala that goes into it&#39;s making. Happy Slow Cooking Everyone!"
